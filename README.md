# Hello World Test Sample

This is a modification of the Hello World example with integration tests setup to be run in Jest instead of Mocha.

## Running the Sample

- Run `npm install` in terminal to install dependencies
- Run the `Jest: Extension Tests` target in the Debug View. This will:
  - Start a task `npm: watch` to compile the code
  - Run the extension integration test in a new VS Code window
